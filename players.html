                    <h3>About Caps</h3>
                    <p>Rasmus ‘Caps’ Winther surprised the world when he joined the team in November 2018, leaving G2’s biggest rival, Fnatic. With Perkz moving to the bot lane to make room for the best player in the West, Caps was quick to show the title was well deserved with a dominating year long performance and winning MVP for the LEC Spring Split and MSI 2019. Moreover, he went on to make history as the first Western back-to-back Worlds finalist. But being the king of the mid lane just wasn’t enough – and so Caps swapped with Perkz, debuting as a bot laner for 2020. For Summer Split, having proven his dominance in bot lane, he swapped back with Perkz and returned to the mid lane.

                        Popping opponents on assassins, mages, and marksmen, Caps is sure to dazzle with his mechanical talents and lovable personality. Furthermore, no matter if it’s Claps or Craps on the Rift, the fan favourite from Denmark can count on the support of his entire family, especially his father, who travels the world to see his son win title after title.</p>
                    <h3>About Rekkles</h3>
                    <p>An incredible competitor, Rekkles is widely regarded as one of, if not, the greatest Marksmen that Europe has ever produced. With over 4 European titles and several deep Worlds runs, including runner-up in Worlds 2018, Rekkles has shown the world his skill, dominance, and determination to win it all. Now, as part of the #G2ARMY, he will.</p>
                    <h3>About Mikyx</h3>
                    <p>Widely considered one of the best mechanical supports in Europe, Mihael ‘Mikyx’ Mehle joined G2 Esports ahead of the 2019 season, battling through a wrist injury to help secure the 2019 Spring Split, Summer Split, and MSI 2019 trophies. A true support, Mikyx makes sure he can facilitate his team however he can, making the transition for his new lane partners as smooth as can be. When not playing League, he’s often watching anime and having strong opinions on anime.</p>
                    <h3>About Wunder</h3>
                    <p>Martin ‘Wunder’ Hansen stands atop of his role as one of the best top laners in Europe. Joining G2 in 2018, the Dane is famous for his play on carries, making his name during 2018 Worlds as G2 Esports made a surprise upset against tournament favourites Royal Never Give Up. Wunder is well known for his creative champion pool, ranging from Pyke to Soraka, much to his opponents’ chagrin. When not dominating his lane, Wunder enjoys strategy games and a little too much WoW Classic.</p>
                    <h3>About Jankos</h3>
                    <p>One of the best junglers and longest standing players in the LEC, Marcin ‘Jankos’ Jankowski joined G2 Esports in 2018. During this time, Jankos has won multiple domestic and international titles, including the 2019 Mid Season Invitational and both LEC 2019 splits, even winning MVP for Summer and becoming the first player in European history to get 1000 kills and 2500 assists.

                        Nicknamed the “First Blood King”, Jankos is known for his incredible early game aggression and playmaking abilities. Excelling on early game champions like Lee Sin and Elise, Jankos juggles his three lanes and enemy jungler with manic precision and a sixth sense for the map.</p>
